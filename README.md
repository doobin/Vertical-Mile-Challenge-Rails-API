## Development Process

At the start of the project, I reviewed the requirements documentation (in full detail) and developed a game plan accordingly.

**Game Plan**

1. Planning
  * Wireframes
  * User Stories

2. Development(Stage1)
  * Create Database
  * Scaffold Resources (Rails)
  * Adjust controllers to handle apps API requests accordingly

3. Development(Stage 2)
  * Basic User Interface Design (HTML and CSS)
  * Back-end Communication: User Authentication

4. Development(Stage 3)
  * Back-end Communication: Log Events

5. Development(Stage 4)
  * Implement Final User Interface Design (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)

6. Deployment
  * Deploy a functional single page application that meets requirements.

My problem-solving strategy was to solve one problem and move on to the next one. Foresee problems during my planning process and plan my game plan accordingly. I used all available resources, including the internet (StackOverflow, Google, MDN, etc), other developers and instructors during my development process.

## Future Updates
